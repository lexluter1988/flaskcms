FlaskCMS is a non-commercial for newbies and strange people like me, who like Flask. 
The project intends to simplify how you create the project structure.

You can be an anonymous user here, just create a project and grab your zip with prepared env, requirements,
and blueprints so that you don't need to read manual every time.

You can register on my site, store a few templates. 
You can generate projects and just see how files are written.
Feel free to use it, send me any feedback. 

Thank you,Alexey 

=== Installation - Dev ====
`install.sh` with `--dev` will do all things. The server will be running on your machine.
Admin will be `admin@example.com`

=== Installation - Production ====

`install.sh` is the simplies way. Just run it as `root` and specify your `user` for running this app.
Also specify `admin_login`, `admin_email` and `admin_password`. 
This will put generate files for nginx, gunicorn, place them into correct places and app will be inited.

==== Bootstrapting ====
In order to have db initiated with `admin` user created and ready for work

```
flask bootstrap
```

This will create everything you need.

==== Maintenance Mode ====
Simply create `maintenance` file in root directort `app`
